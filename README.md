# VSCode-Template
Template project for typescript, sass and gulp with vscode live server.

Run this project with the following commands:

Install all dependencies:

```
npm install 
```

Run the watch command:

```
gulp watch
```

I also use the extensions live server to run the index.html file. 
It might be that you're missing gulp cli to run this correctly refer to the documentation:

https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/

To install the cli run the following command:

```
npm install --global gulp-cli
```
